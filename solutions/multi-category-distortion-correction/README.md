# Multi-Category Distortion Correction

An advanced solution for distortion correction in multi-category psychological assessments that addresses cross-category response bias while preserving meaningful differences between categories.

## 📋 Overview

The Multi-Category Distortion Correction extends beyond single-category bias correction to handle comprehensive assessments with multiple categories. This solution addresses a critical limitation where applying the same correction factor to each category independently can make final scores artificially similar across categories, reducing the assessment's discriminative power.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Cross-Category Pattern Detection**: Analyzes response patterns across all categories simultaneously
- **Relative Difference Preservation**: Maintains meaningful differences between categories while correcting bias
- **Global Response Style Analysis**: Identifies overall response tendencies across the entire assessment
- **Adaptive Correction Strategies**: Applies different correction approaches based on detected patterns
- **Category-Specific Adjustments**: Allows for tailored corrections per category or category type
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Implementation guides for Bubble.io, Python, and JavaScript

## 🔬 Enhanced Correction Algorithm

### Problem with Single-Category Approach

When participants respond to assessments with multiple categories (e.g., 20 categories × 5 questions each):
- Traditional single-category correction treats each category independently
- Results in artificially similar scores across categories
- Loses important relative positioning between different competencies
- Reduces assessment's ability to identify strengths and weaknesses

### Multi-Category Solution

The enhanced algorithm considers:

1. **Global Response Patterns**: Overall tendency to use extreme values across all categories
2. **Category Relative Positioning**: How categories compare to each other before correction
3. **Response Distribution**: Variance and spread of responses within and between categories
4. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment based on total assessment scope

### Mathematical Approach

```
Multi-Category Corrected Score = Base Score × Global Factor × Relative Factor

Where:
- Global Factor: Addresses overall response style bias (0.7 to 1.3)
- Relative Factor: Preserves category differences (0.85 to 1.15)
- Combined correction maintains both accuracy and discrimination
```
