## 🔧 Workflow Implementation

### Core Workflows

#### 1. Initialize Assessment
```
Trigger: Page load / User action
Actions:
1. Create new Assessment Session
2. Set participant_id = Current User's unique id
3. Set status = "in_progress"
4. Set start_date = Current date/time
5. Navigate to first category page
```

#### 2. Record Response
```
Trigger: Radio button selection
Actions:
1. Create new Response
2. Set session = Current Assessment Session
3. Set category = Current Category
4. Set question = Current Question
5. Set value = Selected radio value
6. Set timestamp = Current date/time
7. Update progress indicator
```

#### 3. Calculate Multi-Category Correction
```
Trigger: Assessment completion
Actions:
1. Calculate Global Statistics:
   - Count total responses
   - Count responses with value 5
   - Count responses with value 1
   - Calculate global mean
   - Calculate variance

2. Classify Response Style:
   - IF responses_5_percent >= 0.4 OR global_mean >= 4.2
     THEN response_style = "high_acquiescence"
   - ELSE IF responses_1_percent >= 0.4 OR global_mean <= 2.2
     THEN response_style = "low_acquiescence"
   - ELSE IF (responses_5_percent + responses_1_percent) >= 0.6 AND variance < 1.5
     THEN response_style = "extreme_style"
   - ELSE IF responses_5_percent < 0.1 AND responses_1_percent < 0.1
     THEN response_style = "central_tendency"
   - ELSE response_style = "balanced"

3. Calculate Global Factor:
   - SWITCH response_style:
     CASE "high_acquiescence": 
       global_factor = 1 - min(0.3, responses_5_percent * 0.5)
     CASE "low_acquiescence": 
       global_factor = 1 + min(0.3, responses_1_percent * 0.5)
     CASE "extreme_style": 
       global_factor = 1 - min(0.15, (responses_5_percent + responses_1_percent) * 0.2)
     CASE "central_tendency": 
       global_factor = 1.05
     DEFAULT: 
       global_factor = 1.0

4. For Each Category:
   a. Calculate original category score (average of responses)
   b. Calculate relative positioning
   c. Calculate relative factor based on response style
   d. Apply correction: corrected_score = original_score × global_factor × relative_factor
   e. Ensure score bounds (1.01 to 5.0)
   f. Create Category Result record

5. Update Assessment Session:
   - Set completion_date = Current date/time
   - Set status = "completed"
   - Set response_style = calculated response_style
   - Set global_factor = calculated global_factor
```

### Helper Workflows

#### Calculate Category Score
```
Input: Category, Assessment Session
Output: Average score for the category

Actions:
1. Search for Responses where:
   - session = Input Assessment Session
   - category = Input Category
2. Calculate average of all response values
3. Return average
```

#### Calculate Relative Factor
```
Input: Category Position, Response Style
Output: Relative correction factor

Actions:
1. Set base relative_factor = 1.0
2. Get relative_distance from category position
3. Get is_above_average from category position

4. SWITCH response_style:
   CASE "high_acquiescence":
     IF is_above_average:
       relative_factor = 1.0 + (relative_distance × 0.1)
     ELSE:
       relative_factor = 1.0 - (|relative_distance| × 0.05)
   
   CASE "low_acquiescence":
     IF NOT is_above_average:
       relative_factor = 1.0 - (|relative_distance| × 0.1)
     ELSE:
       relative_factor = 1.0 + (relative_distance × 0.05)
   
   CASE "extreme_style":
     relative_factor = 1.0 + (relative_distance × 0.05)
   
   CASE "central_tendency":
     relative_factor = 1.0 + (relative_distance × 0.1)
   
   DEFAULT: # balanced
     relative_factor = 1.0

5. Ensure bounds: max(0.85, min(1.15, relative_factor))
6. Return relative_factor
```
