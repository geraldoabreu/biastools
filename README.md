# BiasCorrection Hub

A comprehensive repository of solutions for bias correction in various types of tests and assessments. This project centralizes tools and algorithms developed to detect and correct biased response patterns, improving the accuracy and reliability of psychological, educational, and professional evaluations.

## 🎯 Objective

The BiasCorrection Hub was created to:
- Provide robust solutions for bias correction in tests
- Centralize different correction approaches and algorithms
- Offer multi-platform implementations (Bubble.io, Python, JavaScript)
- Facilitate research and development of new correction techniques
- Promote standardization of bias detection methods
