# Shared Resources

This directory contains shared resources used across different solutions in the BiasCorrection Hub.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `datasets/`
Contains shared datasets used for validation and testing of bias correction solutions:
- Sample datasets for different types of psychological assessments
- Validation datasets with known bias patterns
- Benchmark datasets for performance comparison
- Data format specifications and schemas

### `research/`
Contains shared research materials and scientific resources:
- Research papers and literature reviews
- Statistical analysis templates
- Validation methodologies
- Experimental design templates
- Citation databases and references

### `utils/`
Contains shared utility functions and tools:
- Common mathematical functions
- Data processing utilities
- Validation helpers
- Statistical calculation functions
- Cross-platform compatibility tools

## üîß Usage

These shared resources are designed to be imported and used by individual solutions. Each solution should reference these shared components rather than duplicating functionality.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Import shared utilities
import { calculateStatistics } from '../shared/utils/statistics.js';
import { validateDataset } from '../shared/utils/validation.js';
```

```python
# Import shared utilities
from shared.utils.statistics import calculate_statistics
from shared.utils.validation import validate_dataset
```

## üìã Guidelines

- All shared resources should be well-documented
- Functions should be platform-agnostic when possible
- Include unit tests for all utility functions
- Follow the coding standards defined in `/docs/implementation-standards.md`
- Ensure compatibility across JavaScript, Python, and Bubble.io implementations

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new shared resources:
1. Ensure they are truly reusable across multiple solutions
2. Follow the established naming conventions
3. Include comprehensive documentation
4. Add appropriate unit tests
5. Update this README if adding new subdirectories

For detailed contribution guidelines, see `/docs/contributing.md`.
