# Distortion Correction Formula

An advanced solution for distortion correction in psychological assessments that automatically detects and corrects extreme response patterns in Likert scales.

## 📋 Overview

The Distortion Correction Formula is a specialized tool that addresses a critical problem in psychological testing: response bias. When individuals take psychological assessments, they often exhibit extreme response patterns (consistently choosing the highest or lowest scores) that can distort results and reduce assessment validity.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Dynamic Distortion Detection**: Automatically identifies when respondents show extreme response patterns (many 5s or 1s)
- **Bidirectional Correction**: Applies appropriate corrections for both high and low response distortions
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Instant computation and interpretation of scores
- **Professional Interface**: Clean and user-friendly design suitable for professional assessments
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Implementation guides for Bubble.io, Python, and JavaScript

## 🔬 Correction Algorithm

### Distortion Detection
The system uses a dynamic threshold (70% of total questions) to detect distortion patterns:

- **High Distortion** (many 5s): Reduces score by up to 30% to compensate for positive response bias
- **Low Distortion** (many 1s): Increases score by up to 30% to compensate for negative response bias
- **Both Distortions**: Applies both corrections when mixed patterns are detected
- **No Distortion**: Maintains original score when response patterns are balanced

### Mathematical Formula
```
Corrected Score = Base Score × Correction Factor

Where:
- High Correction Factor = 0.7 to 1.0 (0% to 30% reduction)
- Low Correction Factor = 1.0 to 1.3 (0% to 30% increase)
- Detection Threshold = 70% of questions
```
